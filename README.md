# Haskell-Mastermind

A simple, command-line game of [Mastermind](http:/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_%28board_game%29).

If this is something that interests you, feel free to 
use any part of this however you wish!


# Installation

This is a tiny project, and there are no dependencies, other than the Haskell compiler.
To compile, simply:
`ghc Main.hs -o MASTERMIND`



I have only tried this on Linux (Mint), and I suspect the colors will not work properly on any other platform
